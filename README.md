####**Description**
This course is an introduction to Rails applications. It will teach students how to leverage the RoR development ecosystem to create and deploy simple apps. It will touch on the full stack, from designing an application interface, to setting up a database.

####**Learning Objectives**
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:  
* Design and implement simple RoR applications from scratch.
* Read and understand other people’s RoR application code.
* Capture application requirements with unit tests.
* Deploy RoR applications.

####**Format** 
The first 1.5 to 2 hours of each class will be devoted to learning and practicing new concepts.  The rest of the class will be a demonstration of creating a new RoR application from scratch. Homework Assignments will extend the applications started in class.  There will also be Reading Assignments (articles and blog posts) that further explain the concepts of the preceding class.  In the last three classes, students will practice pair programming to implement a more extensive application.
